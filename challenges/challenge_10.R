# Challenge 10 - "Fibonacci Evens Sequence"
# 5 Points + 5 Bonus Points

# Challenge Description:
# Most traditional programmers will run into a problem involving the fibonacci sequence early on in their programming tenure. 
# The Fibonacci sequence can demonstrate many uses of iteration and recurssion. For those who aren't familiar, the Fibonacci 
# sequence is generated as follows: 0-th value is 0; 1-st value is 1; all next values are sum of two immediately preceeding.

# Example: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, ...

# Your challenge is to consider the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million,
# find the sum of the even-valued terms.

# Bonus: Solve the problem using the closed-form solution to the Fibonacci sequence
